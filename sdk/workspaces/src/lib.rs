//! <fullname>Amazon WorkSpaces Service</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows
//! or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as <i>WorkSpaces</i>.
//! WorkSpaces eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex
//! software. You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access their
//! virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.</p>
//! <p>This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
//! parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about the
//! supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Amazon WorkSpaces service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html">WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services
//! General Reference</i>.</p>
//! <p>You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces
//! console, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more information about
//! administering WorkSpaces, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/">Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide</a>.
//! For more information about using the Amazon WorkSpaces client application or web
//! browser to access provisioned WorkSpaces, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/">Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide</a>. For more
//! information about using the CLI to manage your WorkSpaces resources,
//! see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces/index.html">WorkSpaces section of the CLI Reference</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
